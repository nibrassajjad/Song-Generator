Following preprocessing steps are done:\n1. Converting to lowercase: Converting text to lowercase ensures uniformity, so words like \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are treated the same. This reduces the complexity of the data by normalizing variations due to case differences.\n2. Replacing new lines with sapces: Replacing newlines with spaces ensures that sentences or words separated by newlines are still treated as distinct words. It also makes the text a single continuous block, which is easier to process for many natural language processing tasks.\n3. Removing carraige returns: Carriage returns (\\r) are often artifacts of different operating systems' text encoding formats. Removing them ensures consistency in the text format.\n4. Removing extra spaces: Multiple spaces can appear due to text replacements or formatting issues. Removing extra spaces ensures that words are separated by a single space, which is important for tasks like tokenization.\n5.

person or thing is soon to be met he knows every thought, he can feel every emotion oh yes, i did forget something didn’t i? i forgot to introduce you to the monster. you’re fearing me, ‘cause you know i’m a beast watching you when you sleep, when you’re in bed i’m underneath you’re trapped in halls, and my face is the walls i’m the floor when you fall, and when you scream it’s ‘cause of me i’m the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head i heard just what you said that’s why you’ve got to be threatened by me  you should be watching me, you should feel threatened while you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened every time your lady speaks she speaks of me, threatened half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me you think you’re by yourself, but it’s my touch you felt i’m not a ghost from hell, but i’ve got a spell on you your worst nightmare, it's me, i'm everywhere in one blink i’ll disappear, and then i’ll come back to haunt you i’m telling you, when you lie under a tomb i’m the one watching you that’s why you got to be threatened by me   the unknown monster is about to embark from a far corner, out of the dark a nightmare, that’s the case never neverland, that’s the place this particular monster can read minds be in two places at the same time this is judgement night, execution, slaughter the devil, ghosts, this monster is torture you can be sure of one thing, that’s fate a human presence that you feel is strange a monster that you can see disappear a monster, the worst thing to fear.   what you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare. it isn’t. it’s the beginning. i'm in love with a beautiful girl i'm in love with a beautiful girl it's almost like dancing and romancing in her arms it's just a

child lying there scared of the moon she pulls up the covers and shivers in fright she hides from the color that rides on the night the light through the window that lights up the sky and causes her mournful cry scared of the moon there's nothing wrong don't be bothered they said it's just childish fantasies turning your head no need to worry it's really too soon but there she lies shivering scared of the moon scared of the moon scared of the moon scared of the moon scared of the moon the years go by swiftly and soon childhood ends but life is still fearful when evening descends the fear of a child still intrudes the night returning on beams of light scared of the moon the feeling of terror she felt as a youth has turned from a fantasy into the truth the moon is the enemy twisting her soul and taking its fearful toll scared of the moon but now there are others who sit in a room and wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom together they gather their lunacy shade but knowing just why they're scared scared of the moon scared of the moon scared of the moon scared of the moon scared of the moon all alone wishing on stars waiting for you to find me one sweet night i knew i would see a stranger who'd be my friend when someone in the dark reaches out to you and touches off a spark that comes shining through it tells you never be afraid then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow a light to keep you warm when the night winds blow like it was written in the stars i knew my friend, my someone in the dark was you promise me we'll always be walking the world together hand in hand where dreams never end my star secret friend and me when someone in the dark reaches out to you and touches off a spark that comes shining through it tells you never be afraid then
